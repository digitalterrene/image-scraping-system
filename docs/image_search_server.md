### How to Run the Server

1. **Install dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have FastAPI and Uvicorn installed. Run:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. **Start the server**:  
   Use the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn image_search_server:app --reload
   ```

3. **Access the API**:  
   Open your browser or API testing tool and navigate to:  
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
